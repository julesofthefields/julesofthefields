## Hi there, I'm Jules 👋

A little about me (well, mostly my background) in a few bullet points:

**Professional experience 💻**:

- Research Assistant at Columbia University (Sep. 2023 - Dec. 2023), trying to understand differential privacy;
- Quantitative Researcher Intern at Squarepoint Capital (May 2023 - Aug. 2023), refining my excel and kdb/q skills in the Credit team;
- Research / Software Engineer Intern at GeomStats (Feb. 2022 - Aug. 2022), learning how to code and being introduced to geometry (differential and Riemannian);
- Risk Modeling Intern at Amaltea FS (Aug. 2021 - Feb. 2022), building a framework to assess climate-related financial risks.

**Studies 👨‍🎓**:
- MS Operations Research at Columbia University (2022-2023);

**Hobbies 🏀**:
- I like all kinds of sport as long as I am good at them (tennis, soccer, basketball, F1 racing, running);
- Mathematics and coding projects when I have an idea and am not too lazy to execute.
